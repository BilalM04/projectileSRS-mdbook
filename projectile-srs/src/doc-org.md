# Organization of Document

The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by [koothoor2013](), [smithLai2005](), [smithEtAl2007](), and [smithKoothoor2016](). The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the [instance models]() and trace back to find any additional information they require.

The [goal statements]() are refined to the theoretical models and the [theoretical models]() to the [instance models]().
