# Traceability Matrices and Graphs

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. Every time a component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked with an "X" should be modified as well. [Tab:TraceMatAvsA]() shows the dependencies of the assumptions on each other. [Tab:TraceMatAvsAll]() shows the dependencies of the data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, instance models, requirements, likely changes, and unlikely changes on the assumptions. [Tab:TraceMatRefvsRef]() shows the dependencies of the data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, and instance models on each other. [Tab:TraceMatAllvsR]() shows the dependencies of the requirements and goal statements on the data definitions, theoretical models, general definitions, and instance models.
