# Non-Functional Requirements

This section provides the non-functional requirements, the qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

Correct: The outputs of the code have the properties described in [Properties of a Correct Solution]().

Verifiable: The code is tested with complete verification and validation plan.

Understandable: The code is modularized with complete module guide and module interface specification.

Reusable: The code is modularized.

Maintainable: The traceability between requirements, assumptions, theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, unlikely changes, and modules is completely recorded in traceability matrices in the SRS and module guide.

Portable: The code is able to be run in different environments.
