# Instance Models

This section transforms the problem defined in the [problem description](./problem-description.md) into one which is expressed in mathematical terms. It uses concrete symbols defined in the [data definitions](./data-definitions.md) to replace the abstract symbols in the models identified in [theoretical models](./theoretical-models.md) and [general definitions](./general-definitions.md).
